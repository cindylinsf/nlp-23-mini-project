    "# NLP Mini Project // Term 1 // Cindy Lin\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before CCI, I was working on a photo project where I incorporated research on modern fertility practices. In my research, I found aspects of eugenics, unethical marketing practices, and I was interested in exploring this idea further where human genetic materials are objectified as sellable products. I was constantly told by fertility clinics that \"Buying sperms online is as easy as shopping on Amazon.com.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with NLP methods, I want to rework this photo project to see if I can further the research I was doing in 2019/2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, I wanted to create a dataset from the Curated Donor Profiles from https://www.cryobank.com/. Cyrobank California is one of the largest sperm banks based in the United States and I wanted to see if there were specific language used to market this \"curated collection\" the company is promoting as some of their most popular donors. There were only 8 profiles in that particular collection, I felt the dataset was a bit too small to do any sort of real analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I broaden the scrap by ethnic origins of the donors: Caucasian, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino using the site's Donor Search functions (https://www.cryobank.com/search/).\n",
    "\n",
    "On each Donor Profile, I scraped the key marketing descriptions from the site. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headline: A Dreamer and A Doer\n",
    "- Description: One look tells you there’s something special about Donor 16910 with his shoulder-length jet-black hair pulled back into a ponytail, neatly trimmed beard and thick mustache, rosy cheeks, mocha brown eyes, and athletic build. An actor/singer/director with theater and film credits in his native Nepal, this multilingual (English, Hindi, and Nepali) entertainment industry pro is now exploring a career as a writer. He’s a gifted soccer player and a passionate fan of cricket and international cinema.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project, I modified the Wikipedia code from the web crawler/ web scraping notebook to scrape the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, with the curated collection, I wanted to see if there is a trend in the language used in marketing by comparing the frequency of the following in the donor description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical attributes (brown eyes, tall, full head of hair)\n",
    "- Interests (long walks on the beach, likes chicken pot pies)\n",
    "- Accomplishments (great at playing piano, math champion, can type 70 words per minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "After increasing the dataset, now I am grouping donors by ethnic origins to see if I can analyze the dataset and find differences in marketing languages. I am also interested to see if certain keywords are used over and over."

      "6-Foot CPA\n",
      "This driven and resourceful CPA dreams of one day dining with Bill Gates, but money isn’t his top priority; friends and family come first. He’s seriously smart though, with a 3.9 HS GPA and a BA in business. He has a friendly smile, high cheekbones and a 6-foot frame he keeps fit by running. His big, happy Vietnamese family is healthy too, with grandparents living into their 80s and 90s. Oh — and he also gardens, raises chickens, and makes a mean tiramisu. Is there anything this donor can’t do?!\n",
      "4.0 Adventurer\n",
      "This wise donor has one request for future parents: “Life is unpredictable...whoever your child ends up becoming, I hope you support them to be the best possible version of themselves.” With a 4.0 H.S. GPA and a B.S. in computer science, he's certainly the best version of himself. He’s also athletic and adventurous, and even took a historic pilgrimage through China alone. Plus, he was prom king, but humbly admits, \"It was also a random lottery, haha, so I'm not sure how much that counts.\"\n",
      "Athletic Caretaker\n",
      "You might say caring for others is in Donor 18435’s DNA.

Pursuing a full-time acting career was the right move for this born performer, as his amazing hazel eyes, big smile, and impressive natural talent have already earned him a feature film appearance.\n",
      "Car-Loving Biz Guy\n",
      "Donor 17711 has golden-brown eyes, a charming smile, and a genuine laugh. It would be easy to mistake this outgoing 6’1” baseball player for a pro athlete. But he’s actually a business and marketing major, with a passion for tech and engineering. One of his hobbies is building computers and his passion is cars — Japanese imports specifically. He loves Chinese New Year for the food, good fortune, and chance to embrace his Asian culture. He’s also close to his sister, who always has his back.\n",

      "Econ MVP\n",
      "Donor 17866 may be an economics major, but he’ll remind you that no amount of money can buy a minute of time. He often spends his time playing video games with friends. He also enjoys coding because of the knowledge it takes to create and perfect it. A sporty teen, he was an MVP in both lacrosse and football (and an honors student) in high school. Both of his parents have master’s degrees in education, and he calls his dad his hero for the motivation he has always provided.\n",
      "The Tinkering Traveler\n",
      "Donor 17589 is a “tinkerer.” He began with deconstructing things to see how they work and advanced to creating objects with a 3D printer. With an MBA and a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering, he participated in state-level math (and swimming) competitions in high school. A big believer in paying it forward, he volunteers, helping kids with their college applications.

      "B-Ball, Books, and the Butterfly Effect\n",
      "A software engineer, donor 17608 earned a 4.0 while also playing basketball (and being named an MVP) for his university.

      "Double Black Diamond Donor\n",
      "Donor 17564 has deep, dark-brown eyes, and a luscious beard. He is living proof that you can be both analytical and creative. He has a master’s in econ but loves watching cooking shows to inspire his own dishes (sautéing garlic is his favorite scent). And while his personality is highly agreeable, he’s also a master of deadpan sarcasm.

      "Just What the Doctor Ordered\n",
      "Slim, with an athletic build and high cheek bones … and a doctor?! It’s true. Donor 17121’s ambition (he was taking college courses in middle school) led him to his career in medicine. But he’s also always up for what he calls “Type 2” fun — an experience that’s not fun in the moment but rewarding in retrospect — like when he hiked to the top of a volcano. He enjoys traveling, and has visited more than two dozen countries, including China, where he spent a year learning about his heritage. He believes “everyone has something they can teach you,” and calls the smiling quokka his spirit animal.\n",

      "PhD Piano Prodigy\n",
      "If you’d seen Donor 16816 as a child playing a Beethoven sonata on the piano in his small village in China, you would have known immediately that this prodigy was destined for great things.

His childhood love of animals has led this extremely fit Nicholas Tse lookalike to multiple degrees in animal science and the career of his dreams. Many lifelong friendships began on a basketball court for this quiet, but not shy, bilingual (English/Japanese) athlete.

      "Genius Level Hero\n",
      "As a member of Mensa, Donor 16187 is literally a genius, who enjoys “exploring the esoteric.” And although he has his degree in econ, his “strong calling to protect his community” led him to join the military — and to his career as a firefighter. He calls it his dream job, not only because it is so meaningful and rewarding, but also for the firehouse comradery it provides. Close to his family, his father gifted him with a love of the great outdoors. And always striving to “learn more about himself and the world,” he spent over a year backpacking around the globe. Next on his bucket list…Antarctica.\n",
      "Trilingual Triathlete\n",
      "The first thing you notice about Donor 15928 is his dimples. Next, is his impressive work ethic and determination. He juggled exams, an internship, and taking the GRE (as a second language) during college and managed to earn a full scholarship to a prestigious graduate school. He co-founded a company and worked 100+ hours a week to grow the company. Despite those long hours, he maintained a healthy lifestyle by exercising at a gym close by, eating a balanced diet, and getting enough rest by sleeping at the office instead of commuting.\n",
      "Top Tech\n",

A lifelong foodie, he expresses himself by cooking for friends. Check out his nori chicken recipe in the Express Yourself section of his profile!\n",
      "The Best Man and Musician\n",
      "It’s no surprise that Donor 18436 has been a best man 4 times; he is good vibes personified, with an extroverted energy that just makes people happy.

      "Blue-Eyed Brainiac\n",
      "His striking blue eyes and fair skin give away his Irish ancestry, but you might not guess that Donor 18599 is also part Argentinian and speaks both English and Spanish. A brainiac with a 3.9 HS GPA, he's also an accomplished athlete who played varsity basketball. Plus, he's creative; this guy's passion for gold and silver smithing inspired him to go backpacking in the mountains to prospect for gold. He went mining and panning, and even found some gems! A true original.\n",
      "Caribbean Charmer\n",
      "With dark, long lashes, and dimples, Donor 18552 gets his broad shoulders from competitive weightlifting when he was younger. He graduated from high school two years early (with an associate degree), then got a bachelor’s in psychology and studied post grad — with a 4.0.

      "Cool Jazz Innovator\n",
      "Tall, slim, with beautiful dark brown hair, and a nice smile, Donor 17981 is as creative as he is handsome. A dedicated after-school instructor by day, this jazz musician comes alive at night when he’s playing piano in a club with a small combo.

      "A Man With a Plan\n",
      "He has a beautiful olive complexion, with dark features, and soulful eyes. His perfect day starts at dawn and must include the great outdoors — preferably with a lake included. A lifelong soccer player, Donor 16495 believes an active body is a healthy body and is the key to “feeding your brain.” With a degree in public policy and a business in electronics, he’s a tenacious perfectionist who says a bad plan is better than none at all. But he also prides himself on his patience. Top of his class in high school, he believes in science, constant learning, and is a whiz at chemistry.\n",
      "A Cross-Country Communicator\n",
      "An eloquent speaker, Donor 16403 has his master’s in communications —graduating early, with a 4.0. A lifelong lover of the outdoors, he competed in cross country, as well as skiing (downhill and cross country) in high school. He once joined a community service group to make new friends. It worked, and earned him 240 service hours. He gets his quick thinking and DIY car repair skills from his dad and believes, if you’re willing, you can learn anything. When a conversation gets heated, he will always lead the party out of conflict, toward a solution. And he likes how dogs are always happy to see you.\n",
      "Plays Like Hendrix\n",
      "Donor 16701 lives and breathes music. He has what in the business is called “an ear” – that rare gift which enables musicians to quickly learn and play virtually any – in his case stringed - instrument you can name. An inventive experimental jazz guitarist, this bilingual (English/Russian) sound engineer and composer splits his time between studying audio production and playing in a rock band where he’s the charismatic front man with the beautiful green eyes and the unforgettable fashion sense.\n",
      "Staff Favorite\n",
      "Tall and attractive with beautiful eyes, a nice smile, and an athletic build, Donor 16620 is a staff favorite. Smart with a kind heart, great sense of humor, and thirst for adventure, he lives his life to the fullest. Quick to offer his time and energy to others, this former lifeguard volunteers frequently and is proud to work at a nonprofit where he supports people in need. Not afraid to take charge, he’s held multiple leadership positions in academic societies and on sports teams. He loves the outdoors and it wouldn’t be unusual to find him whitewater kayaking, rock climbing, or on a hike reciting the script to the Lion King. This thoughtful soul is closest to his sisters and grandmother and above all else he values honesty and compassion.\n",
      "Movie-Star Looks. All-Star Talent.\n",
      "A talented professional musician, a gifted athlete, and a bit of a philosopher – there’s a lot to this handsome, 6’1” guitarist (Adult Photos Available). Charismatic with a great sense of humor, Donor 16948 is super social and makes lasting friendships easily. An adventurous home chef, his Korean dumplings are AMAZING (check out the recipe in his Express Yourself).\n",
      "Fit and Funny Architect\n",
      "“I would mark sarcasm as a language I am fluent in if I could,” jokes Donor 16386. He loves to laugh — at anything from overused dad jokes to comically horrendous horror flicks — and self-identifies as a huge nerd. But he's also a lifelong athlete; he played competitive tennis and now practices mixed martial arts. This caring, empathetic donor is very close to his little brother, who he helps with navigating bullies, crushes and more. An interior architect, he has a B.A. in architecture.\n",
      "Spanish Romantic\n",
      "Donor 18127 is a personable physical therapist who’s always ready to learn something new. Suave with wavy dark hair and big brown eyes, he could be confused for James Bond. He likes rom-coms and sunsets and remembers the first time he fell in love. He was five. Cycling keeps him fit. Yoga, meditation, and mindfulness keep him balanced. And he’ll tell you (in his charming Spanish accent) his fondest memories are of making empanadas with his grandparents. His favorite spot: on the dance floor.\n",
      "Dream and Achiever\n",
      "Growing up in El Salvador in the loving care of two his grandmothers, Donor 16828 joined his parents in the U.S. at 15.

      "Strong Swimmer\n",
      "Currently wrapping up his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography with a 3.9 GPA, Donor 17651 is happily following his dreams as the first in his traditional Mexican family to pursue a college degree and work in the arts.

      "Fitness is His Thing\n",
      "Looking like a cross between Succession’s Nicholas Braun and former LA Dodger Brandon Morrow? Donor 16908 is a quick learner who can do seemingly anything he sets his mind to. This super fit father of three holds multiple degrees and certifications, flies helicopters, trains for triathlons, and when he’s not working his two jobs attends a master’s program for Finance.\n",
      "Master of All\n",
      "Donor 17894 is more versatile than a Swiss army knife. Graduating first in his class (with his bachelor’s degree), he also has a master’s in electrical and computer engineering. And while technically employed as a researcher — studying everything from AI to the environment — he’s also an artist (using time-lapse cinematography or computational photography), and an educator. He loves to laugh, make others laugh, and ride his bike. And he believes you should never be afraid to help others.\n",
      "Language & Arts\n",
      "He’s the definition of a creative spirit, as he’s truly gifted in the arts - from singing and playing multiple instruments, to creating independent films and writing poetry.

      "Master's in Language\n",
      "Donor 18088 has dark wavy hair and a kind smile. With a master’s in translation, he calls language “a cultural code to any nation.” He thinks his motorcycle is the perfect symbol for the (responsible and disciplined) “free spirit” he is. His favorite tradition involves gathering with his Kazakhstani family to share dreams for the new year. He believes you can choose to be happy, that our souls share an inseparable bond with nature, and reading about history is the next best thing to a time machine.\n",
      "Model Citizen\n",
      "His bright green eyes and impeccable smile might be what you first notice about Donor 16677. (Adult Photos Available) But this model and actor’s most attractive characteristic may be his altruism. Since he was 12 years old, he’s organized a toy drive every year on his birthday, so he could give back to underprivileged kids.

Calm and decisive, he bases his decisions on their potential impact. He cares about his community and inclusivity, being most proud of his positive influence on the kids he tutors.

      "AI Altruist\n",
      "Donor 17954 may be an applied mathematics major working in AI, but he prioritizes making genuine connections with people … IRL.

      "Rock-Climbing Mathlete\n",

Proud of his Columbian heritage, he is a friendly, bilingual (English/Spanish) people-person who enjoys dancing with friends to EDM and dreams of becoming a pilot.\n",
      "Great Performer\n",
      "Is there a word for people who are multitalented to the tenth power? If so, it would perfectly describe Donor 17690. He’s a gifted performer whose credits include appearing in 15 stage plays and two feature films, plus countless standup sets and improv performances.

      "After graduating from his university with a 4.0 GPA in Water Utilization and Preservation Studies, Donor 17728 began doing critical work in a highly specialized environmental field that is growing in importance with each passing year. As serious as that sounds, this highly intelligent, bilingual (English/Russian) charmer has another side. He’s a talented songwriter who is happiest when playing guitar and bass with his two bands. Fun for him includes snowboarding, writing poetry, and ping pong.\n",
      "Charming Ph.D.\n",
      "If you ever need a tennis-loving, javelin-throwing Ph.D. in neuroscience to help you change the sparkplugs on your ’63 Stingray, Donor 17416 is your man.

      "The Jiu-Jitsu Kid\n",
      "Cars, carpentry, plumbing, computers… you name it and this renaissance man can do, build or fix it. An accomplished mixed martial artist who loves the outdoors, Donor 17457 is happiest breaking trail in the wilderness heading to a secret fishing spot. His deep sense of integrity and strong personal values led him to work in security and private investigation; but he’s thinking it’s time to apply his natural gift for debating at law school now that he’s wrapped up his BA in Communications.\n",
      "Double Black Diamond Donor\n",
      "Donor 17564 has deep, dark-brown eyes, and a luscious beard. He is living proof that you can be both analytical and creative. He has a master’s in econ but loves watching cooking shows to inspire his own dishes (sautéing garlic is his favorite scent). And while his personality is highly agreeable, he’s also a master of deadpan sarcasm.

With a Balinese, Russian, Hindu, and Jewish background, his family’s favorite holiday tradition is eating Chinese food and going to the movies.\n",
      "Has an Eye for Detail\n",
      "Thanks to his grandfather, Donor 17212 loves nature and the outdoors, including playing varsity high school football, collecting rare plants, or even hiking the Appalachian Trail. His part-time high school job at an ice cream shop helped him discover he likes to delve behind the scenes and learn how to keep things running smoothly — be it people, inventory, or workflow. That led him to earn his supply chain management degree, graduating with honors, in just three years. He is a handsome, grey-eyed, ambidextrous “cat guy,” who always has a “dad joke” ready to make you smile.\n",
      "Not Your Average Joe\n",
      "A “cat person” who owns a dog, this soon-to-be certified radiology tech is a fun but complex guy. Says he’s shy but is a former theater kid who’s a fearless public speaker and a talented singer. Looks like Tom Holland but denies it.

      "AMBIDEXTROUS & AMBITIOUS\n",
      "The fact that Donor 17279 is ambidextrous explains a lot. On the one hand, he’s smart and funny (friends say he reminds them of John Mulaney).

Kind, generous, yet competitive, his life is defined by hard work, good times, and a passion for new experiences. Skilled at sports, growing businesses, and learning to play instruments, he's always up for a challenge. (Adult Photos Available)\n",

      "Future PhD\n",

Level 2 and Level 3 items are view only and NOT DOWNLOADABLE. Subscriptions are non-refundable.\" These are removed as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Removing special characters and punctuation\n",

Removing Stop Words: In additions to removing common words like \"the,\" \"is,\" \"in\", etc., I will also remove the word \"donor\" since that's going to be appearing at a very frequent level in each of the dataset. I also ended up removing more words like \"he\", \"his\", etc. that doesn't contribute to the results. Since I want to see the most frequently used keywords in the descriptions.\n",
